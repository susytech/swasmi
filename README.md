# `swasmi`

WASM interpreter (previously lived in [swasm](https://github.com/susytech/swasm))

Primary purpose of `swasmi` is to be used with [susy](https://github.com/susytech/susy) (sophon-like contracts in wasm) and with [Superstring](https://github.com/susytech/superstring). However, `swasmi` is designed to be as flexible as possible and might be suited well for other purposes.

At the moment, the API is rather low-level (especially, in the part related to host functions). But some high-level API is on the roadmap.

# License

license and the Apache License (Version 2.0), at your choice.
